🐕‍🦺 Linz Dog Free Zones :

A simple, clean SwiftUI app that helps dog owners in Linz find official Hundezonen / Hundefreilaufzonen quickly and easily.

📍 What This App Does:

Linz Dog Free Zones shows all dog play zones in Linz on a beautiful map. Users can:
• View all official dog zones on an interactive map
• Tap on a marker to see detailed zone information
• Filter zones by fenced/unfenced and water availability
• See zone size, city district, and surface type
• Use the app fully offline (local JSON data – no internet required)
• Enjoy a smooth, fast, lightweight SwiftUI experience

The app is built for simplicity: fast, clean UI, and zero unnecessary features.

✨ Features:

🚀 Future Improvements
These are future ideas:
• Add search bar to quickly find a zone by name
• Add user location tracking for "closest dog zone"
• Add route navigation to the selected zone
• Add favourites tab
• Expand coverage beyond Linz (Wels, Vienna, Graz…)
• Add feedback/report button for inaccurate zone data
